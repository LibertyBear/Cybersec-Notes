msfconsole

case: Port uses smb, we can find a way to exploit this (i guess xd)

> search smb

say we are interested in the module "auxilary/scanner/smb/smb_version"

> use auxilary/scanner/smb/smb_version

to see info about the module:

> info

so for instance, in this case, we can set RHOST to the target ip:

> set RHOST <ip>

and run

> run

and get additional info on the host.
